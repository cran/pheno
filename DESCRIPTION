Title: Auxiliary Functions for Phenological Data Analysis
Version: 1.7-0
Date: 2022-05-12
Author: Joerg Schaber
Description: Provides some easy-to-use functions for time series
        analyses of (plant-) phenological data sets. These functions
        mainly deal with the estimation of combined phenological time
        series and are usually wrappers for functions that are already
        implemented in other R packages adapted to the special
        structure of phenological data and the needs of phenologists.
        Some date conversion functions to handle Julian dates are also
        provided.
